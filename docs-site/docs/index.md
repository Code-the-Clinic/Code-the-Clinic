# Code the Clinic

## Project Goals
### Main objective
Help athletic training students and administrators evaluate student workload and learning outcomes by logging and analyzing patient interaction data.​

### Problems our project will solve
- **Tedious data entry:** Currently faculty in the athletic training department manually enter, aggregate, and analyze patient interaction data from Qualtrics forms at the end of each semester, which is time-consuming and tedious. We will automate the data aggregation and analysis process, saving hours of work.
- **Underutilized data:** Through our automated data analytics pipeline, we will surface insights that manual analysis would take too long to find.
- **Stale data:** We will update our database every time students fill out the patient interaction intake form, solving the current problem of data only being analyzed once a semester
- **Limited customizability:** The current approach is very program-specific; we will make our interface modular and easy to use so it can meet the needs of multiple programs.

### Core features
- Secure MyBama authentication
- Quick, easy patient interaction intake form for students
- Analytics dashboard visualizing patient loads and interaction types for faculty
